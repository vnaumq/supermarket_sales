<h4 align="center" style="color:White">About Research </h4>

In this study I have analyzed the sales of three supermarkets. I analyzed each product line individually. I also analyzed sales by month, by day of the week and by week. In this study I did a lot of work with time. I converted date as in weeks, months, days, days of the week and time as in hours. Also built a lot of graphs: pie, barplot, lineplot, histplot, relplot. Figured out the percentages of different payment methods. **Also translated all the python code into SQL language. The jupyter notebook describes everything, what which part of the code does what.**
